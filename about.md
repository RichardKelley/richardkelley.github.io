## About Me

<img src="/img/me.jpg" alt="An image of Richard Kelley standing in
front of a self-driving car." width="500" />

I am a roboticist and the senior engineer at the Nevada Center for
Applied Research, where I lead research and development focused on
automated vehicles and intelligent transportation systems. I also
provide technical support for Nevada Autonomous, which manages the
State of Nevada's [Federal Aviation Administration Unmanned Aircraft
test
site](https://www.faa.gov/uas/programs_partnerships/test_sites/locations#nv){:target="blank"},
a role that I have filled on and off for [several
years](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/nasa-marks-success-for-most-complex-drone-traffic-management-test-yet-at-faa-test-sites){:target="blank"}.

### Videos

As a part of my research on automated vehicles, I have developed a
ROS-based software stack to drive a Lincoln MKZ. Here's a video of
that system driving autonomously in suburban Reno, Nevada:

(As with most of our testing, I am also the safety driver for this
drive.) 

You can watch videos of some of my other work on my [YouTube
page](http://www.youtube.com/user/rkell209){:target="blank"}.

### Social Networks

When I am able to, I like to share software via
[Github](https://github.com/RichardKelley){:target="blank"}. I also
tweet occasionally about robotics, artificial intelligence, and
math. You can find me on Twitter
[here](https://twitter.com/richardkelley){:target="blank"}.
