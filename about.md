## About Me

I am a roboticist, currently working on self-driving cars at the
[University of
Nevada](http://www.unr.edu/intelligent-mobility){:target="blank"}.

### Videos

I occasionally make videos about my work. You can find them on my
[YouTube
page](http://www.youtube.com/user/rkell209){:target="blank"}. Here's
an early video from my current project, showing some basic
self-driving on my test platform:

</p>

### Social Networks

I write code. When I share that code, I do it through
[Github](https://github.com/RichardKelley){:target="blank"}. I also
tweet. You can see those tweets
[here](https://twitter.com/richardkelley){:target="blank"}. You can
also email me. My email address is my first name, followed by a dot,
followed by my last name, at Gmail.
