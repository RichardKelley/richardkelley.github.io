  I am a roboticist and computer scientist. I am currently a clinical assistant professor of computer science at the <a href="https://catholic.edu" target="blank">Catholic University of America</a>. Before September 2025, I was the senior engineer at the Nevada Center for Applied Research, where I led research and development focused on automated vehicles and intelligent transportation systems. I was also the senior engineer for Nevada Autonomous, the State of Nevada’s <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/programs_partnerships/test_sites/locations#nv" target="blank">Federal Aviation Administration Unmanned Aircraft test site</a>, a role that I filled on and off <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-unr-researchers-work-with-nasa-on-drone-traffic-2015aug09-story.html"
