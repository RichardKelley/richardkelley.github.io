## About

I am a computer scientist working on artificial intelligence and
robotics. I currently work at the [University of
Nevada](http://www.unr.edu/intelligent-mobility).

### Videos

I occasionally make videos about my work. You can find them on my
[YouTube
page](http://www.youtube.com/user/rkell209){:target="blank"}. Here's
one of my recent videos, showing the work I'm doing on the University
of Nevada's autonomous car:

### Social Media

I write code. When I share that code, I do it through
[Github](https://github.com/RichardKelley){:target="blank"}. I also
tweet. You can see those tweets
[here](https://twitter.com/richardkelley){:target="blank"}. You can
also email me. My email address is my first name, followed by a dot,
followed by my last name, at Gmail.
