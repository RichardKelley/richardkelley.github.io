## Videos

Successful robotics projects lend themselves to interesting
videos. Below are videos I've made for some of the projects I've
worked on recently.

### Autonomous Car Driving in Reno

<p>I have written a software stack for self-driving in suburban
settings. Originally inspired by the architecture of Baidu's Apollo
platform, this video shows the ROS-based system driving in suburban
Reno, Nevada.</p>

### Beacon-Based Collision Avoidance

<p>My team worked with a Canadian startup in 2021 and 2022 to
demonstrate beacon-based pedestrian collision avoidance. The idea
shown in the video below is that an app broadcasts the pedestrian's
position to a server, which is queried by the car's motion planner to
enable planning in the presence of sensor range limitations and
occlusion.</p>

<p>This video shows one of the few tests where I was not the safety
driver. Instead, you can see me walking in front of the car, which
does autonomously stop as I walk out from behind the tree into the
path of the car.</p>

### Automated Vehicle Simulation

<p>There are a lot of interesting self-driving car simulators, but our
simulation needs have tended not to align with the features provided
by current open-source solutions. We rarely need high-fidelity
graphics for our projects, but we need to be able to accurately
simulate vehicle dynamics, planning, and control. The result has been
that I have ended up writing a very basic OpenGL-based vehicle
simulator, which I have used to debug controllers (including our
current model predictive controller) and planners.</p>

<p>The video below shows a simulated pedestrian (the circle) crossing
the path of a self-driving car, which is following a path that was
loaded from an actual drive of the physical car. The data for this
simulation was generated as part of the beacon-based collision
avoidance project described in the previous video.</p>

### ROS-based Autonomous Vehicle Visualization

<p>One of my goals in developing a self-driving car software stack was
to make the system depend on ROS as much as possible. My team ran
into difficulties with certain parts of ROS almost immediately,
particularly around data management and visualization. The video below
shows some of the difficulty of using ROS bags with the RVIZ
visualizer. My experience led me to develop tools for data processing
and visualization that could deal with the volume of data generated by
a self-driving car.</p>
