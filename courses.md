## Course Materials

My general philosophy of teaching (especially in Computer Science and Engineering) is that students learn best when they have the chance to work on problems in the presence of an instructor who can provide feedback in a fairly tight loop. This is best done in the context of one-on-one instruction, but can be approximated in a regular course using a flipped instruction style, where I assign readings and videos for students outside of class, and then in class we work through Jupyter notebooks together. I have taught several traditional lecture courses (see [my CV]({% link richard-kelley-cv.pdf %}){:target="blank"} for the full list), but whenever I have had the chance to teach a flipped course I have generally put the Jupyter notebooks for the class online. The list below captures most of those notebooks for the courses I have taught.

- **Autonomous Vehicle Reading Group**

  In 2018 I ran a reading group for Computer Science students interested in understanding algorithms and software for autonomous cars. I collected a list of resources for that group here: [Readings for AV Group]({% link av_readings.md %}).

- **CSE 793: Independent Study: Deep Natural Language Processing**

  I have taught several advanced courses on using deep learning to solve problems in natural language processing. These courses were mostly taught in a flipped style. After covering core concepts in the first few weeks of the course, the students would then propose and build a large project over the course of the semester.

  Some of the Jupyter notebooks for this course can be found [on Github here](https://github.com/RichardKelley/neural-language-models){:target="blank"} and in another [Github repository here](https://github.com/RichardKelley/nlp17){:target="blank"}.

- **CSE 491/691Q: Introduction to Deep Learning**

  I have taught a number of courses on machine learning generally and deep learning specifically. Like my NLP courses, these were typically flipped courses taught in computer labs where the students worked on Jupyter notebooks after having done some reading before class. The main repository for these notebooks can be found [on Github here](https://github.com/RichardKelley/deep-learning){:target="blank"}. For a fun bit of history, note that the "Torch" notebooks actually cover the original version of Torch, which was implemented in Lua! 

- **CSE 482/682: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence**

  I taught an intro to AI course for seniors and beginning graduate students on two occasions. Both times the course used Russell and Norvig as the textbook, but the second time I taugth the class (in 2015), my focus shifted dramatically in the direction of machine learning: both deep learning and an attempt at covered reinforcement learning from the perspective of Bertsekas's dynamic programming and optimal control book. That second part was less successful, but the machine learning was well received. The repository that I used [can be found at Github here](https://github.com/RichardKelley/ai-fall-2015){:target="blank"}.

- **CSE 491/691H: Introduction to Data Science and Big Data**

  In 2014 I taught an introduction to data science. This also served as an introduction to SQL and relational databases for most of the students in the class. The main repository for the class [can be found here](https://github.com/RichardKelley/intro-data-science){:target="blank"}.
