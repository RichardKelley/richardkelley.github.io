## Software



Open-source software is an important part of what I do. Here are some
open-source packages I've developed or contributed to. For quick
reference here's the list:

- [Novatel GNSS Driver](#gnss-driver)
- [Kinetic PR2](#pr2-kinetic)

### - <a name="gnss-driver"></a> Novatel GNSS Driver

[Github link](https://github.com/RichardKelley/gnss_driver)

This package 

### - <a name="pr2-kinetic"></a> PR2 Kinetic Packages

[Github link](https://github.com/RichardKelley/kinetic_pr2)

One of the most frustrating things about working with a PR2 is the
need to work with an old Ubuntu distribution and an old ROS
distribution. This collection of packages aims to fix that by making
the PR2 work with Gazebo and Moveit on Ubuntu 16.04.
