I have a few new graduate students this semester. They're coming in
with a solid background in AI, but they're all working on the car so
they need to get (more) up to speed on robotics. To that end, we're
going to be doing weekly readings related to robotics and self-driving
cars. Check out the list [here](/readings.html)
