<p>I am a roboticist and computer scientist.</p>

<p>Until recently, I was the senior engineer at the Nevada Center for Applied Research, where I led research and development focused on automated vehicles and intelligent transportation systems. I was also the senior engineer for Nevada Autonomous, the State of Nevada’s <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/programs_partnerships/test_sites/locations#nv" target="blank">Federal Aviation Administration Unmanned Aircraft test site</a>, a role that I filled on and off <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-unr-researchers-work-with-nasa-on-drone-traffic-2015aug09-story.html"
target="blank">from 2015</a>.</p>

<p>As a part of my research on automated vehicles, I developed a ROS-based software stack to drive a Lincoln MKZ. Here’s a video of that system driving autonomously in suburban Reno, Nevada:</p>

<p>(As with most of our testing, I was also the safety driver for this video.)</p>
