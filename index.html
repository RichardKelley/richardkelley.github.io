<p>I am a roboticist and the senior engineer at the Nevada Center for
Applied Research, where I lead research and development focused on
automated vehicles and intelligent transportation systems. I am also the 
senior engineer for Nevada Autonomous, which manages the State of
Nevada’s <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/programs_partnerships/test_sites/locations#nv"
target="blank">Federal Aviation Administration Unmanned Aircraft test
site</a>,
a role that I have filled on and off <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-unr-researchers-work-with-nasa-on-drone-traffic-2015aug09-story.html"
target="blank">since 2015</a>.</p>

<p>As a part of my research on automated vehicles, I have developed a
ROS-based software stack to drive a Lincoln MKZ. Here’s a video of
that system driving autonomously in suburban Reno, Nevada:</p>

<p>(As with most of our testing, I am also the safety driver for this
drive.)</p>

<p>When I am able to, I like to share software via
<a href="https://github.com/RichardKelley" target="blank">Github</a>. I also
tweet occasionally about robotics, artificial intelligence, and
math. You can find me on Twitter
